# Life Game

In this project I created the popular game [LIFE](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Игра_«Жизнь»).

## Stack Technologies

- React
- Electron js
- Material UI

## Testing

To test the game, you need to enter the following commands:

- #### `git clone git@github.com:ToxichQQQ/LifeGame.git`
- #### `npm install && npm start`
- #### `electron .`

After these actions, the localhost with the game will start

To create an installation file for Windows, enter `npm run package`

After that, go to the dist/win-unpacked folder and run LIFE.exe
